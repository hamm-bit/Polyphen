# Genmai
### (used to be Polyphen)

Originally an Imperative programming language.

A practice for learning the down-to-ground application of prog lang theory.

Current phase of the language aims to build an interpreter, whilst a compiler with llvm backend is planned in the future.

### Future goals
Found interests in adding strong parallelism to the language alongside the planned concurrency enhancements.

A language of (kind of) purely functional paradigm, with core syntaxes mostly inspired by Haskell and Rust.

### Current development will be very slow. 
It is quite a far bridge from what I originally intended to achieve with this project, as well as from my area of knowledge.

Current phase of the project will be done mostly in updated notes and some small snippets,
  - Feasibility of possible features
  - Deeper theories in FP
  - System concurrency
  - (Advanced) Nodal awareness in a network.
  - ...

P.S. the name Genmai is a reference to Tea **Polyphen**ols which inspired the original namem, as well as opposition to Java (lol).
